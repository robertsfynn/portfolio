The idea was to create a simple landing page, that uses animations to look modern and inviting.

Because Wordpress seemed overkill for such a simple page, I decided to use Gatsby with the Netlify CMS, to use the benefits of Gatsby but still have a CMS to let the client make easy changes.

The page also uses parallax scrolling and Lottie to have a really nice logo animation to really stand out.
