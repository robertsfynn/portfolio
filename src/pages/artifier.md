The basic idea of the client was a simple landing page, which should be designed modern and minimalistic. Apart from a given design, I could decide for myself how the page would be implemented. I decided to use Gatsby and Netlify CMS because Wordpress seemed a bit too complex for such a simple landing page. This enabled me to take advantage of Gatsby and still offer the client the possibility to make changes easily and independently afterwards.

Furthermore, I used parallax scrolling on the page and added an appealing animation of the logo based on Lottie, which gives an inviting user experience.
