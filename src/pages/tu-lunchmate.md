This application was an assignment for a module in university. We got split up in different groups and developed a solution with the technology of our choice.

We chose React for the Front-End and Firebase as the Back-End, as some members already had experience with those.
Firebase allowed us to focus a lot on the Front-End of our project, as its easily integrated into React and has many features right out of the box.

The App lets you create a profile, create temporary rooms to find students at your university with similar interests.
