This application was an assignment for a module in university, for which we, in groups, developed a solution with the technology of our choice. Our app should enable students to create a profile with their own interests as well as temporary rooms to find the right lunch partner.

We chose React for the front-end and Firebase for the back-end collectively, as some of the group members already had experience with these technologies. Firebase has given us the opportunity to work intensively on our front end of our project because itâ€˜s easy to integrate with React and offers many ready-to-use features.
