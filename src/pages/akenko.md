To try out React Native and Typescript, I wanted to create a project for a hobby of mine, which is fitness.

As it was my first React Native App I decided to use Expo, which after extensive research seemed like the easiest solution.

The App allows to create/edit workouts, start and track them.<br/>
This App is still under development, with features planned such as: statistics, featured workouts, ...
