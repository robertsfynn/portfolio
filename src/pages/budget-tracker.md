The idea for the app was evolved out of the intend to have more control over my finances. While searching the Appstore, I primarily found pay walls for basic functions, like budgeting and statistics, which did not meet my expectations. So I decided to develop my own solution where you can track transactions, meet budgets and ultimately view statistics.

I developed the Budget Tracker with React and Firebase and put special emphasis on a minimalist and clean UI. The app is mobile first, as I assumed that most people would use the tracker on the way as soon as expenses occur.
