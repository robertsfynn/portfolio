When I wanted to start tracking, where I spend my money, I went to the App Store and found mostly pay walls for simple stuff like statistics.
So I decided to develop my own solution in React and Firebase as a challenge.

As one would mostly use the Tracker while not at home, it's mobile first, with a simple and clean UI.
Shows statistics for what you spend the most money and lets you create budgets, so you never spend too much.
